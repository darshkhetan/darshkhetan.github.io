                                       How fast the years have flown
                                   Since we brought our "Princess" home
                                        Memories made of pure gold

                               We still remember the baby we used to hold

                                      And it seems like only yesterday

                                 We used to smile as we watched her play
                                        Dressing up and having a doll
                                       She really was no trouble at all


                                 Through teenage years she set the trend
                                 Our little princess became our best friend

                                     We'd chat all day and have a whirl
                                 Our little one had become a gorgeous girl

                               And today we'll brush away a few small tears

                            Those memories we'll treasure for all of our years
                                    Our hearts just leap, so full of pride,

                            Our "Princess daughter" is now "A Beautiful bride"

                                              All our love always
